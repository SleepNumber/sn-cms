For people who are not hydrating well over a long period of time, this diminished sleep quality and quantity will affect cognitive, emotional, and cardiovascular health,\" warns W. Christopher Winter, MD,<b> </b>President, Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine, and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solution-Why-Your-Broken/dp/0399583610/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Sleep+Solution&amp;sr=8-2\">\"The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix It\"</a><i>.</i>\n\n \n\n<i></i>Now more than ever, we should all <a href=\"/why-you-should-focus-on-quality-sleep-during-pandemic/\">Focus on Quality Sleep During the Pandemic</a>.\n\n \n<h2>Symptoms of Nightly Dehydration</h2>\n \n\n<b></b>If you don't want to wake up dehydrated, first watch out for these dehydration symptoms:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Dryness of the mouth and nasal passage</li>\n \t<li>Snoring</li>\n \t<li>Leg cramps</li>\n \t<li>Waking up thirsty</li>\n \t<li>Urine that is a deep yellow or golden color. It should be the color of pale straw or transparent.</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h2>9 Ways to Stay Hydrated for a Solid Night of Sleep</h2>\n \n\nStop right there if you plan to start guzzling gallons of water right before bedtime. That will just make you get up several times to urinate.\n\n \n\nHere's how to retain enough H2O to promote a more blissful sleep:\n\n \n<h3>1. Get Adequate Hydration from Several Sources</h3>\n \n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk\">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,</a> total water intake should be around 3.7 liters for adult men and 2.7 liters for adult women per day. Keep in mind that this includes water contained in beverages and food.\n\n \n<h3>2. Drink Water Throughout the Day</h3>\n \n\n<b></b>Don't chug it down all at once; you'll just excrete the excess.\n\n \n<h3>3. Time Your Caffeine Intake</h3>\n \n\n<b></b>Drink about 12 to 16 ounces of water when you first wake up and before you have any caffeine, a diuretic which dries you out. Get your shot of caffeine between 90 minutes after you wake up and try to stop around noon.\n\n \n\nNoon? Why does it matter what time you drink your last caffeinated beverage?\n\n \n\nThe caffeine molecule competes directly with adenosine, an important neurotransmitter connected to sleep. Furthermore, it takes your body eight hours to metabolize caffeine. So if you drink a latte or a caffeinated soda at 3 p.m., half the caffeine from that beverage is still circulating in your body at bedtime.\n\n \n\nSleep Number® <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/pages/sleepiq-sleep-tracker\">SleepIQ<sup>®</sup> data</a> confirms sleepers who regularly drink caffeine after noon are less restful and sleep far less than those who never do. Those who regularly drink caffeine in the evening have 19 fewer minutes of restful sleep each night than those who never do.* Do this every day and those 19 minutes of poor sleep per night could add up to almost 115 hours of junk sleep per year! Whoa, right?!\n\n \n\nIf you're drinking caffeine after noon, you're all but guaranteeing you won't get quality sleep. You may be so tired that you still fall asleep, but caffeine is going to disrupt your sleep and wake you up and/or disrupt your sleep cycles so you wake up more groggy.\n\n \n\nAnd don't forget: chocolate has caffeine (sorry).\n\n \n<h3>4. Limit Alcohol</h3>\n \n\nStop drinking alcoholic beverages three hours before bedtime and have one glass of water for each alcoholic beverage since alcohol is a huge dehydrator.\n\n \n<h3>5. Regulate the Temperature</h3>\n \n\nKeep your bedroom cool and humid. If it's too warm and dry, you will dehydrate faster. This applies all the way down to beds and bedding options. The new <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/pages/360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sleep Number 360® smart bed</a> helps you create your own personal microclimate. It has a more breathable mattress and balances surface temperature to help you stay asleep all night.\n\n \n\n<b>INTERESTING FACT: </b>According to Dr. Michael Breus, PhD, American Board of Sleep Medicine and Fellow, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we lose about one liter of water while we're asleep — just based on the humidity in our breath.\n\n \n<h3>6. See a Certified Sleep Physician About Snoring and Other Breathing Issues</h3>\n \n\nSnoring and other breathing issues cause your mouth to fall open, drying out the membranes. Your doctor may recommend a C-PAP (continuous positive airway pressure therapy), which increases air pressure in your throat, so it doesn't collapse when you inhale.\n\n \n<h3>7. Sleep With a Closed Mouth</h3>\n \n\nIf your mouth keeps falling open, and it really bothers you, talk with your doctor about considering a chin strap.\n\n \n<h3>8. Place Some Water Beside Your Bed</h3>\n \n\n<b></b>Bring a glass or bottle of water with you when you go to bed. You can take a sip if you wake up and fall right back asleep.\n\n \n<h3>9. Aim for the Best Quality Sleep You Can Get</h3>\n \n\nIt's not always possible but try to keep to a reasonable schedule. The <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/2/zsy210/5155420\">Sleep </a>study mentioned above found that \"people who reported that they regularly slept for six hours or less each night were 16–59% more likely to be dehydrated than those who slept for eight hours a night.\"\n\n \n\n<b>INTERESTING FACT:</b> Good news! Sleep Number® smart bed owners get almost 100 hours more proven quality sleep per year.**\n\n \n\nRead more about room temperature: <a href=\"/from-head-to-toe-how-sleep-temperature-affects-each-part-of-your-body/\">From Head To Toe: How Sleep Temperature Affects Your Body</a>.<b></b>\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep has a profound impact on our physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.

              "html": "<i>Six sleep-boosting steps that can make your workouts more effective.</i>\n\n \n\nIt's true: Quality sleep can make or break an athlete's performance. Whether you're tackling an event like a marathon or simply want to exercise more consistently, it all starts and ends with your shut-eye.\n\n \n\nWe have compiled six sleep-boosting steps that can make your workout challenge easier. But first, let's have a look at why sleep is so important.\n\n \n<h2>The Negative Impacts of Too Little Sleep</h2>\n \n\nThink about the last time you didn't get enough sleep. Did you feel it the next day?\n\n \n\nCutting yourself short on sleep <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/happens-body-dont-get-enough-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has a number of short-term effects</a>. You may notice decreased alertness, impaired memory, increased stress levels, worse overall performance and a higher risk of injury.\n\n \n\nMaybe it made you skip a workout, or maybe it made you forget simple tasks for your job.\n\n \n\nIt's not just the short-term impact, though. Over time, poor quality of sleep can lead to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">serious health concerns</a>, including a higher risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, cancer, stroke and more.\n\n \n\nStill not convinced? Sleep problems can alter your physical appearance, too. Dark circles under the eyes, excessive wrinkling and rougher skin can all be linked back to a chronic lack of sleep.\n\n \n\nThose long-term effects will be less of a worry if you focus on sleep now. Between quicker reaction time, fewer mistakes and a lower chance of injury, it's clear getting quality sleep every night will make your workouts more effective. So how can you make sure it happens?\n\n \n<h2>Set Goals for Your Health and Wellness</h2>\n \n\nBy setting goals for your health and well-being, you're committing to take action. Keep the goals tangible, too. It's easy to say we'll sleep longer or exercise more. Because those goals are less concrete, we're less likely to follow through on them.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"https://www.wholefamilyliving.com/setting-wellness-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Effective goals</a> follow the S.M.A.R.T. model. They're Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. Once you've determined your main goal, break it out into smaller objectives to reach your accomplishment.\n\n \n\nFor example, if running a mile sounds like a nightmare, start by walking 15 minutes one day. The next day, set a goal to walk for 14 minutes and run for one. The following day, walk for 13 minutes and run for two, and so on. After two weeks, you'll knock out that mile in style.\n\n \n\nNot sure where to begin with a workout at home? Here are five activities you can do <a href=\"/5-ways-to-exercise-without-leaving-your-bed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">without leaving your bed</a>. Bonus: By boosting your muscle mass at the <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/working-out-in-the-morning#benefits\">start of the day</a>, you'll sleep more soundly at night. <a id=\"_anchor_1\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/ZT3VD1I5/Why%20Everyday%20Athletes%20Need%20Quality%20Sleep%20for%20Better%20Workouts_sp%20edits%208%2019%2020.docx#_msocom_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"></a>\n\n \n<h2>Take Notes From the Pros</h2>\n \n\nProfessional athletes always have to be at the top of their game. Even if we're not playing in a Super Bowl or World Series, we can look to them for some pointers.\n\n \n\nFor example, star baseball players have said that they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/sports/baseball/justin-verlander-all-star-sleep.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up their sleep game</a> by using blackout blinds and keeping technology away from the bed. Basketball pros have pointed out that they ensure their room temperature is cool, which is conducive to better sleep. Some pro athletes <u>have found relaxation apps</u> helpful in catching more quality zzz's, too.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, NFL athletes are <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com/nfl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">better tracking their sleeping habits</a> with <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com/nfl\">Sleep Number 360® smart beds</a> with <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sn/en/sleepiq-sleep-tracker\">SleepIQ® technology</a>. They can monitor things like restful sleep and heart and breathing rate so they have a better sense of what's going on while they're not awake. They use this information to help with training and recovery to improve their energy, recovery and immunity.\n\n \n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdV7l3x3ABs&amp;list=PLR6a2QUEJa7D9Z8SiYpyo_i5rVWv_7oeg&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s[/embed]\n\n \n\nIn general, athletes are more in tune with their body and often develop a sleep routine throughout the season. Once they find their groove, they may not even need an alarm clock. They simply wake up with a refreshed body and mind.\n\n \n\nYou don't have to be an elite athlete to aim for this. Your body typically won't lie to you. When it's gotten enough rest, it'll respond positively. When you short it on sleep, your body will make you suffer the consequences.\n\n \n<h2>Start a Schedule</h2>\n \n\nPro athletes receive their schedules at the start of every season. They prepare their workouts and sleep habits accordingly. This is great inspiration for everyday athletes, too. Look at your schedule for the coming week. Is there anything that would stop you from going to bed at the same time every night?\n\n \n\nPerhaps you have a friend's birthday coming up. That means moving a workout to the morning or scheduling a longer workout the day after.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleepiq-sleep-tracker\">Sleep Number SleepIQ® sleepers</a> who say they exercise regularly are the most restful overall, have the highest SleepIQ® score, and the lowest average heart rate and breath rate compared to those who exercise occasionally or rarely.*\n\n \n\nAnd, pay attention to the time of day you work out and observe if it's impacting your sleep that night. <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleepiq-sleep-tracker\">Sleep Number SleepIQ® sleepers</a> who say they exercise in the afternoon receive the most restful sleep, compared to those who exercise at other times.\n\n \n\nTo take it a step further, build a consistent nightly routine. For example, turn off the TV one hour before bed, write down tasks for the next day or meditate for ten minutes. To help, Sleep Number® created a completely free <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge</a> where 82% of participants experience better quality sleep and 74% improve or change a poor sleep habit. What have you got to lose?\n\n \n\n\n \n<h2>Shine Some Light</h2>\n \n\nGet outside and enjoy some sun. According to studies, exposure to sunlight increases <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">both length and quality of sleep</a>. On a nice day, why not take your workout to the backyard, driveway or patio?\n\n \n\nOn average, every one hour spent outdoors advances your sleep by approximately 30 minutes. Spending a half hour in the sun during the day means going to bed 15 minutes earlier. That extra 15 minutes could make all the difference for your workout tomorrow.\n\n \n<h2>Watch Your Diet</h2>\n \n\nGo to bed too hungry or too full and you may have trouble falling asleep. Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol can also disrupt sleep, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to Mayo Clinic</a>. Limit these substances during the day and avoid consuming them close to bedtime. Here's a helpful article from the wellness experts at Sleep Number® with <a href=\"/5-foods-avoid-before-sleeping/\">5 foods to avoid and 5 to try instead before bed</a>.\n\n \n\nWorkouts are no different. Overeat before one and you'll feel lethargic. Alcohol causes dehydration, which will make your workouts both unpleasant and more risky. <a href=\"https://aaptiv.com/magazine/drinking-before-workout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A general rule</a>: leave an hour-long buffer between each drink and your workout. You can work out in the evening, but <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-exercising-at-night-affect-sleep#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20experts%20have%20recommended%20not,least%20one%20hour%20before%20bedtime.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">researchers recommend</a> avoiding strenuous exercise one hour before bedtime.\n\n \n<h2>Create a Restful Environment</h2>\n \n\nMost people sleep better in a cool, quiet and dark environment. Try blackout blinds or <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-pink-noise-might-just-help-you-get-a-better-nights-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pink noise</a> to eliminate external light and noise.

              "html": "<em>Turn these 5 immune-boosting kitchen staples into tasty snacks that promote well-being and quality sleep.</em>\n\n \n\nLooking for ways to naturally boost your immune system? The easiest and tastiest way, of course, is through the foods we eat and the quality of sleep we get.\n\n \n\nMost of you have likely read or heard about the beneficial, good-for-you properties of vitamins C, E, B complex and magnesium for starters. Immune-boosting powerhouses A and D, as studied in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906676/\">this report</a>, are being linked with the ability to metabolize in our immune system to help fight the good fight. Beta carotene, oxalic acid and other beneficial nutrients naturally found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, complex carbohydrates and fish are also key to keeping the body ready to ward off any pesky virus.\n\n \n\nHere are five immune-boosting pantry staples (including that cold pantry, the fridge) and ways to turn them into tasty snacks or light meals that promote well-being and quality sleep:\n\n \n<h3>1) Plain Greek Yogurt</h3>\n \n\nFound in fridges across the land, plain, naturally low-in-sugar Greek yogurt is a body's dairy-friendly \"bestie\". It contains calcium, protein, probiotics (for your gut health), iodine, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. The latter helps regulate the immune system and boosts the body's natural defenses against illness.\n\n \n\nAnother bonus? <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25879690/\">A study</a> published in 2016 found that those who consumed 100 grams of yogurt a day, or took a daily probiotic capsule, felt less anxiety, depression and stress than those who did not. The study concludes that this is likely because of the brain-gut relationship and the ability of the gut to make serotonin and dopamine, the neurotransmitters that help with the aforementioned conditions.\n\n \n<h5>Get Your Daily Dose:</h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Make a quick breakfast parfait: layer your plain Greek yogurt with a drizzle of maple syrup, slices of fresh banana, mango, and blueberries or strawberries. Add a few magnesium-rich pepitas or dry-roasted nuts on top for crunch (magnesium helps nerve and muscle function).</li>\n \t<li>Top a big, hearty bowl of multi-bean chili or your favorite soup with yogurt instead of sour cream.</li>\n \t<li>Add to casseroles, pasta or rice dishes instead of cream for a probiotic kick!</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>2) Cinnamon</h3>\n \n\nApart from being a key spice in everyone's pumpkin spice latte, cinnamon (we're talking about \"true\" or Ceylon cinnamon), is also prized for a slew of health benefits. It's high levels of cinnamaldehyde, known to ward off bacteria and infections, is part of what makes this delicious spice so valued. In fact, cultures around the world use cinnamon as a natural food preservative. High in antioxidants, it's also an anti-inflammatory that helps fight infections and repair tissue damage.\n\n \n<h5>Get Your Daily Dose: <img class=\"alignright wp-image-11771 size-body_copy_4to3\" src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIndvcmthcmVhL2NvbnRlbnQvYXNzZXRzL3BsYWNlaG9sZGVyIl1d/placeholder.png?sha=66bab4576cc0c6c1\" alt=\"Cream smoothie in glass container with paper straw and cinnamon on top.\" width=\"278\" height=\"438\">\n</h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Swirl Ceylon cinnamon into your favorite herbal tea or even a good cup of coffee (think of it as your very own Mexican-style coffee).</li>\n \t<li>Sprinkle onto cubed and roasted butternut, acorn or gem squash.</li>\n \t<li>Use in root vegetable-based soups, curries and stews.</li>\n \t<li>Add to your mid-afternoon smoothie with one whole banana, a cup of your favorite juice (lychee, orange, pineapple all work), a half cup of Greek yogurt or plain kefir, 1/4 teaspoon of Ceylon cinnamon (plus extra for sprinkling on top) and a heaping cup of ice cubes. Blend, pour, dust with a little extra cinnamon, sip and savor!</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>3) Citrus Fruit</h3>\n \n\nCitrus is high in vitamin C, which increases the production of white blood cells used to fight off infections. So squeeze every drop of golden goodness from oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, mandarins, pomelos, tangelos and the like! Did you know your body doesn't store or produce this vitamin? So make sure you enjoy your citrus fruits daily!\n\n \n<h5>Get Your Daily Dose Of Citrus:</h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Lemon and lime juice brighten up anything from a salad dressing, freshly grilled piece of fish, chicken, pork, taco, dip or drink!</li>\n \t<li>Use citrus zest in desserts, homemade granola or with fresh herbs for a rub, marinade or drizzle.</li>\n \t<li>Squeeze the juice of tart citrus (lemon or lime), add fresh ginger and honey, and warm in a small saucepan, then let it cool. This elixir becomes the perfect way to add an immune-boosting punch to a cup of herbal tea, or mixed with water for a refreshing drink.</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>4) Tea</h3>\n \n\nGrab a cuppa and drink up, because tea — whether green, black or white — delivers antioxidants, disease-fighting polyphenols and flavonoids in every sip.\n\n \n\nGreen tea in particular is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110602143214.htm\">being studied</a> for its ability to naturally affect the number of regulatory T cells, which can improve immune function.\n\n \n<h5>Get Your Daily Dose (Beyond The Cup):</h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Steep your favorite tea in coconut milk, cream or any other liquid to infuse its flavor into anything — from rice puddings, ice creams, custards, risottos, soups and poached fish to vinaigrettes.</li>\n \t<li>Use dry black or green tea leaves to smoke meat or fish — the flavor it imparts is unique and delicious.</li>\n \t<li>The tannins in strong-brewed black tea make a great meat tenderizer. Marinate your meat for several hours before grilling or roasting for next-level results.</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>5) Oatmeal</h3>\n \n\nOatmeal isn't just for breakfast. This soluble fiber-rich, cholesterol-lowering superfood (it's true, check out this <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27724985/\">British Journal of Nutrition study</a>), is good most any time of the day, in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\nExtra points for the beta-glucans naturally found in oats that helps boost infection-fighting blood cells. It doesn't hurt that oats also have zinc and selenium, two nutrients known for helping to keep infection at bay. Oh, and thanks to the tryptophan found in oats (an amino-acid the brain turns into serotonin), your body can relax so that you can get a better night's sleep!\n<h5></h5>\n<h5>Get Your Daily Dose Of Oats:<img class=\"alignright wp-image-11769 size-body_copy_4to3\" src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIndvcmthcmVhL2NvbnRlbnQvYXNzZXRzL3BsYWNlaG9sZGVyIl1d/placeholder.png?sha=66bab4576cc0c6c1\" alt=\"Oats in blue bowl with egg on top.\" width=\"274\" height=\"438\">\n</h5>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A savory oatmeal with 1 cup of cooked steel cut oats, one soft-boiled egg, a handful of garlic-sautéed vitamin C-rich greens (baby kale, spinach or chopped Swiss chard), 2 slices of smoked salmon, a drizzle of olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and a dollop of Greek yogurt with a snip of fresh chives makes for a filling, tasty light lunch.</li>\n \t<li>Combine quick oats with your favorite nut butter, dark chocolate chips, honey, dried fruit, chopped walnuts, warming spices like cinnamon or ginger, and you've got power balls that work as hard as you do!</li>\n \t<li>Throw a handful of rolled oats in your meatballs, meatloaf or burgers instead of bread crumbs. You get a fiber boost and the nutty nuance of oats — a win win.</li>\n</ul>\n \n\nGiving your immune system a helping hand is as delicious as it is good for you.

              "html": "Once you've ruled out a medical problem by seeing your doctor and assessed how many hours of quality sleep you're getting per night, you may need to make some lifestyle changes to increase your energy levels. In the meantime, focusing on the following nine tips for good energy may help reverse feelings of exhaustion.\n\n \n<h2>1. Set a Regular Bedtime and Stick to It</h2>\n \n\nIt seems simple, but if you're not keeping a regular sleep routine, your body may revolt with a lack of energy. A study in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4\">Nature</a> found irregular sleepers (those with an inconsistent sleep and wake cycle) had later bedtimes and more daytime sleepiness. Those considered regular sleepers got significantly more sleep than sporadic sleepers.\n\n \n\nThe average bedtime of Sleep Number's SleepIQ® sleepers is 10:29 pm, and the average wake-up time of SleepIQ® sleepers is 7:10 pm.<b> </b> How do you compare?\n\n \n<h2>2. Drink Enough Water</h2>\n \n\nDehydration is an energy sucker. Research published in Oxford's journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/2/zsy210/5155420\">Sleep</a> highlighted a link between poor sleep and dehydration. The study found that short sleep - less than six hours nightly - is linked to kidney function and your hydration status. So aside from getting in your zzz's, drink plenty of H2O (just not too close to bedtime or you'll be waking up for late-night bathroom runs).\n\n \n<h2>3. Work Out</h2>\n \n\nSeem counterintuitive? Yes, physical activity tires you out, but it boosts your energy later. Exercise releases endorphins, helps with sleep, decreases stress and strengthens your heart and lungs, so they work more efficiently and deliver oxygen to all your organs. This raises your energy levels and combats fatigue. Getting in daily exercise is one small way you can feel more energetic and sleep better at night. SleepIQ® sleepers who exercise daily are the most restful overall, have the highest SleepIQ® scores and lowest average heart rates.* Take a walk, do yoga, get in a bike ride, or start a workout practice you enjoy, so you'll stick with it.\n\n \n<h2>4. Eat Smaller Meals More Frequently</h2>\n \n\nBig meals can zap energy levels, since they divert energy to your digestive system. “A rich, heavy meal close to bedtime will interfere with your rest and leave you feeling sluggish in the morning,\" says Nancy Gerstein, author of <i>Motivational Yoga: 100 Lessons for Strength, Energy and Motivation.</i><a id=\"_anchor_1\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/ZT3VD1I5/Always%20Tired%207%20Lifestyle%20Changes%20to%20Reverse%20your%20Lack%20of%20Energy_SP%20edits_FINAL.docx#_msocom_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"></a>\n\n \n\nInstead, experiment with eating more frequent small meals to see if you notice an uptick in energy. Also, if you're constantly on the hunt for a snack, a lack of sleep can be the culprit, making you feel hungrier. Experts say it's better to take a nap than eat mindless calories to fill your vitality cup. Smaller, more frequent meals may control cravings, too. If you just can't kick your nighttime snack, <a href=\"/how-to-snack-smarter-when-youre-sleepy/\">learn how to snack smarter</a>.\n\n \n<h2>5. Limit Cocktails</h2>\n \n\nMost people know that drinking alcohol can affect your sleep by making you initially drowsy and then waking you up in the middle of the night. But if you drink during low energy times, like mid-afternoon or late evening, you can really zap your stamina, reports <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/alcohol-and-fatigue\">Harvard Medical School</a>. Alcohol's sedative quality can make you feel even more lethargic. Reach for water instead, or water-filled foods like fruits, veggies and soups, which can provide the energy you need. According to the <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a>, a glass of wine or beer or a cocktail around dinner is fine, but alcohol right before bed is a bad idea. Even if you don't wake up in the middle of the night, you'll get junk sleep and won't wake up feeling as rested as you could. Moderation is always important!\n\n \n<h2>6. Find Ways to Cut Stress</h2>\n \n\nA Chinese study in the <a href=\"https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8524\">Journal of Sleep Medicine</a> found insomnia was rampant during the height of the pandemic due to anxiety, fear and social distancing challenges. Sleep is elusive when you are worrying about the virus, the economic fallout and the family, causing more stress. Can you relate?\n\n \n\nThat's why experts recommend finding ways to decompress during the day, and especially in the evening: whether it's yoga, a meditation practice, listening to music, journaling, watching a comedy, or any other way to stop the worrying.\n\n \n<h2>7. Get Outdoors</h2>\n \n\nAccording to psychologists, spending time outside helps you shrug off societal pressures and boost your immunity by breathing in phytoncides (airborne particles from plants). It also gives your brain an energy boost similar to a cup of coffee.\n\n \n\nA study in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5981243/\">Behavioral Sciences</a> found that visiting green spaces reduced cortisol, the hormone responsible for increased stress levels and lack of energy. Spending just 20 minutes in nature can significantly decrease your stress and make you feel more energetic.\n\n \n\n<b></b>And, you can bring nature indoors with houseplants too. Here's a great article about how <a href=\"/houseplants-will-supercharge-sleep/\">houseplants can help supercharge your sleep</a>.\n\n \n<h2>8. Improve Your Sleep Habits</h2>\n \n\nTake the <a href=\"https://mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a>, a free 30-day online wellness plan to improve your sleep habits so you learn to create a routine that works for you. While 82% of participants experience better sleep quality, 74% improve or change a poor sleep habit.<a id=\"_anchor_1\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/ZT3VD1I5/Always%20Tired%207%20Lifestyle%20Changes%20to%20Reverse%20your%20Lack%20of%20Energy_SP%20edits_FINAL.docx#_msocom_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"></a>\n\n \n<h2>9. Focus on Quality Sleep Over Quantity<b></b>\n</h2>\n \n\nYou may not be sleeping as many hours as you'd like, so make sure the hours you do sleep are the best <b>quality</b> sleep possible to keep your energy levels up and immune system in fighting form. Good news is Sleep Number research shows that <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> bed</a> owners get almost an hour's more sleep per night than the average sleeper.**\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal well-being and performance.

Keep reading for more on what it is and how to track it to improve your sleep quality, boost immunity and regulate metabolism.</i>\n\n \n\nIf groggy mornings and sleepless nights are the norm for you, it's time to chat about circadian rhythm, or your body's internal clock. The magical, intuitive nature of your body's cells can tell when you need sleep — and how much.\n\n \n\nSo can we bypass sleep issues if we simply pause and listen?\n\n \n\n\"Quality sleep is a priority and should be considered a pillar of health and well-being, on par with good nutrition and physical exercise,\" said Dr. Eve Van Cauter, Chair of <a class=\"ck gg in io ip iq\" href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleep-science#advisory-board\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sleep Number's</a> Scientific Advisory Board.\n\n \n\n\"Consistent sleep and activity patterns have a positive impact on our overall sleep quality. Most relevant to the current pandemic, there is strong scientific evidence indicating that insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality have an adverse effect on the immune system and may make you more susceptible to viral infection,\" Van Cauter adds. \"So by maintaining good sleep habits, you can boost your immunity and increase your resistance to the coronavirus.\"\n\n \n\nHonoring our circadian rhythm not only helps us get better sleep, but also regulates our metabolism, according to Dr. Kent Smith, sleep expert and president of the American Sleep &amp; Breathing Academy. Smith explains, \"Without the circadian rhythm, our sleep patterns, as well as other essential bodily functions, become disrupted and sleep problems can occur.\"\n\n \n\nLet's learn more about how circadian rhythm works, how it affects our sleep and how you can harness it to get the best quality sleep.\n\n \n<h3>What Is Circadian Rhythm?</h3>\n \n\nOur bodies have an internal 24-hour clock known as circadian rhythm. It regulates several bodily systems, including our sleep/wake cycles. The system manages feelings of sleepiness and alertness to tell us when to go, go, go, and when to snooze.\n\n \n\nAccording to Dr. Smith, the circadian rhythm is regulated by a specialized group of cells in the brain, called the circadian clock. The circadian rhythm follows the direction of the circadian clock to regulate key bodily functions, including temperature, energy levels and hormones. The circadian clock uses the hormones melatonin and cortisol to dictate what time the body becomes drowsy or alert.\n\n \n\nWithout a circadian rhythm, our bodily functions — including sleep patterns — would be disrupted. And likewise, when we don't honor our body's internal clock, and push against our innate need for rest during the day, our sleep at night may suffer.\n\n \n<h3>How To Get Better Sleep According To Your Circadian Rhythm</h3>\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11709 size-body_copy_3to4\" src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIndvcmthcmVhL2NvbnRlbnQvYXNzZXRzL3BsYWNlaG9sZGVyIl1d/placeholder.png?sha=66bab4576cc0c6c1\" alt=\"Phone with wellness report on screen.\" width=\"324\" height=\"648\">\n\nBefore you can improve your sleep, you need to find out what happens when you hit the sheets. To make things super simple, <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleepiq-sleep-tracker\">Sleep Number 360® smart beds</a> have sleep tracking built into them, called SleepIQ® technology, that helps you understand how your body is recovering overnight, so you can better manage your days and improve the quality of your sleep. You don't have to wear anything. You just lay in your bed and it does the rest.\n\n \n\nFor example, this tech can give you insights based on your sleep data to help you understand your ideal daily schedule — when to go to bed, when to wake up, when to work out, and when to start winding down.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the SleepIQ® app's <a href=\"https://support.sleepnumber.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052057334-SleepIQ-Heart-Rate-Variability#:~:text=HOW%20IT%20WORKS,age%2C%20gender%2C%20and%20health.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Heart Rate Variability</a> feature measures your heart rate and the variation in time between beats. As you sleep, the app collects biometrics that you and your health care professional can study together to learn what shifts you need to make in your daily (and sleeping) routine for optimal health and restorative sleep sessions.\n\n \n\nIn the meantime, there are several things you can do to optimize your time to get the best sleep possible.\n\n \n<h3>Respect The Light-Dark Cycle Of Each Day</h3>\n \n\nThe key is to be intentional about your light exposure, especially first thing in the morning and before bed. Get outside when it's bright to remind the body to stay awake and feel alert. Seek bright light exposure in the morning and avoid it in the evening. Exposure to natural daylight is a powerful tool for keeping the biological clock in sync. After the sun sets, let your body naturally shift into relaxation and sleep mode. This means avoiding blue light from electronics such as smartphones, televisions and computers at least one hour before bedtime.\n\n \n<h3>Follow A Daily Routine</h3>\n \n\n<b></b> <a href=\"https://mysleep30.com/week-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">If you exercise</a>, eat, and go to bed at the same time each day, your body learns that cycle and knows when it should feel more alert and when it's time to fall fast asleep. Dr. Van Cauter recommends trying to keep a normal sleeping habit by setting up your sleep-wake cycle and sticking with it. Plan the day, and be careful not to let the evening drag on until wee hours.\n\n \n\nIt is also important to remember that a good night's sleep comes after a good day of activity. Getting physical activity into our daily routine reduces levels of anxiety, which can have a tremendous impact on your sleep.\n\n \n\nDr. Van Cauter says our bodies' internal clocks are supported by consistent sleep routines. If you adhere to a routine in which you go to bed and wake up at about the same every day, you can minimize the possibility of adverse health effects. Multiple well-documented studies have shown that insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality increase the risk and the severity of a wide range of conditions, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n \n<h3>Set Your Bedroom For The Evening</h3>\n \n\nThe body's internal temperature fluctuates during the night as we enter various stages of sleep. For optimal zzz's, <a href=\"/perfect-temperature-sleeping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keep the bedroom cool</a> between 60 and 67 degrees and choose bedding made from breathable materials.\n\n \n\nIf you follow all of these tips to regulate your sleep cycle, but still find yourself feeling groggy and tired during the day, contact your doctor. A sleep test may help rule out an underlying sleep disorder.\n\n \n\nIf you need help creating good sleep habits to help you wake up with more energy, consider enrolling in the free <a href=\"http://mysleep30.com/challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a>. You'll set up a new sleep schedule, refine your bedtime routine and learn how your daytime choices, such as exercise, meals and stress management, affect your slumber. With a little more attention on your days and circadian rhythm, better nights await.\n\n \n\n<i>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep has a profound impact on our physical, emotional and mental well-being.</i><em>Because no two people sleep the same, Sleep Number 360® smart beds, with SleepIQ® technology, sense your movements and automatically adjust firmness, comfort and support to keep you both sleeping comfortably and provides</em><i> </i><em>proven quality sleep.

Believe it or not, your bedding may be to blame for your nighttime sweats and chills.\n\n \n\nSelf-proclaimed hot sleeper Kristen Hicks makes reducing heat at night a priority, otherwise insomnia sets in for her.\n\n \n\n\"It's less about when I crawl into bed though and more about getting hot or staying comfortable throughout the night,\" she notes.\n\n \n\nIf your evening ritual includes being mindful of temperature too, you're not alone. In fact, 80% of couples sleep too hot or too cold* and need to make adjustments to their bedroom before drifting off. This might include changing the thermostat, opening a window or turning on a fan for a cooling breeze.\n\n \n\nLet's learn how temperature affects our sleep and explore the best bedding choices for those of you who sleep too hot or too cold — so you can finally snooze at a temperature that feels just right.\n\n \n<h3>Does Temperature Actually Affect Your Sleep?</h3>\n \n\nYes! The body is happiest when it's in a state of being \"thermally neutral\". This means it doesn't need to release heat via sweating or create warmth via shivering. It's the sweet spot for sleep. You can help create this ideal environment by <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleep-better-solutions/best-temperature-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">setting your thermostat to 65 to 68 degrees</a>.\n\n \n\n\"I start out with my comforter pulled all the way up to my chin because I like the comfort of it. Usually in the night I go back and forth with the bedding on and off depending on how bad the <a href=\"/why-do-i-sweat-when-i-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">night sweats</a> get,\" explains Margo Leisinger, an Iowa resident who creates a cool sleeping environment by using a fan and wearing lightweight pajamas.\n\n \n\nWhen you or your bedroom are too cold or too hot at night, expect increased wakefulness, a decrease in REM sleep and slow wave sleep, according to a paper published in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427038/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Journal of Physiological Anthropology</i></a>. In other words: YOU WAKE UP GROGGY AND TIRED and don't have as much energy as you'd like.\n\n \n<h3>What Should You Have on Your Bed for Better Sleep?</h3>\n \n\nFor many of us, picking out pillows and bedding focuses on colors or patterns that coordinate with bedroom décor. We challenge you to go one step further and consider the quality and type of bedding you're using if you have trouble finding the right sleep temperature.\n\n \n\nTemperature-balancing bedding can absorb excess body heat. It works to keep you warm as you fall asleep, then provides cooling to help you stay asleep without the need for adjustments at night. Yes, smart bedding is a thing, and it's awesome.\n\n \n\nSo, let's make the bed — with temperature in mind:\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<b>Pillows</b>: A cool pillow is a must for many, choose pillows that help regulate your temperature at night. <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/All-Pillows/Pillows/p/true-temp-pillow\">True Temp™</a> pillows unique active-particle technology attracts and removes moisture vapor to resist heat and humidity buildup.

              "html": "<em>Discover the reasons behind nightly hot flashes and cold chills, and try these tips for keeping them in check.</em>\n\n \n\nYou wake up suddenly, drenched in sweat and feeling as though a heat wave has blown through the room. Then you get chills from the sweat clinging to your skin. Now that you're awake and uncomfortable, you have trouble falling asleep again.\n\n \n\nSome sweating during sleep is <a href=\"/why-do-i-sweat-when-i-sleep/%20\">normal and healthy</a>. But sleep-disturbing night sweats occur when someone experiences a hot flash at night. A hot flash is a sudden sensation of intense heat that seems to hit your body all at once. Your face may flush, and sweat may prickle on your skin. Chills often follow hot flashes or night sweats because the sweat does its job—cooling off the body.\n\n \n\nHot flashes typically only last a few minutes, but they can feel deeply uncomfortable. While they are often annoying or frustrating during the day, the disruption they cause at night is often worse. Night sweats can interfere with getting a good night's sleep or even <a href=\"http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32880197/\">cause insomnia</a>. Not getting a <a href=\"/5-surprising-health-benefits-good-nights-sleep/\">good night's sleep</a> can then cause or exacerbate other health problems.\n\n \n<h3>Why You May Experience Hot Flashes at Night</h3>\n \n\nThe most common reason for hot flashes in women is <strong>menopause</strong>. In fact, up to <a href=\"http://www.menopause.org/for-women/sexual-health-menopause-online/causes-of-sexual-problems/hot-flashes\">three in four women</a> experience hot flashes that can last anywhere from a few years <a href=\"http://www.menopause.org/for-women/expert-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions-about-menopause/hot-flash-faqs-triggers-symptoms-treatments\">up to a decade</a>, according to The North American Menopause Society. Decreasing estrogen levels are the primary culprit for hot flashes during menopause.\n\n \n\nBut menopause is not the only reason for hot flashes. <strong>Other hormonal changes</strong> can cause them as well, in women and men. People with thyroid dysfunction or people taking hormonal medications to treat cancer and other conditions may experience them.\n\n \n\nCertain <strong>infections </strong>can cause hot flashes, even if someone doesn't notice other symptoms.\n\n \n\nResearchers are still learning how flashes develop, but they seem to happen because of changes in the part of the brain that <a href=\"http://www.menopause.org/for-women/expert-answers-to-frequently-asked-questions-about-menopause/hot-flash-faqs-triggers-symptoms-treatments\">regulates temperature</a>, called the hypothalamus. If the hypothalamus incorrectly senses that a person's body has gotten too hot, it enlarges the blood vessels near the skin's surface. Blood flow rushes toward the skin as the body attempts to release the heat. Paradoxically, it's that rush of blood flow that makes you feel hot.\n\n \n\nShort of telling your brain to knock it off (which doesn't seem to work), there are things you can do to lower the frequency or severity of night sweats and reduce your discomfort when they happen.\n\n \n<h3>Notice Your Triggers for Hot Flashes</h3>\n \n\nStart paying attention to what happens shortly before a hot flash. See if you can identify what your body's common triggers are so you can try to avoid them. The following are common triggers for hot flashes and night sweats:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Alcohol</li>\n \t<li>Caffeine</li>\n \t<li>Spicy food</li>\n \t<li>Smoking or secondhand smoke</li>\n \t<li>Stress</li>\n \t<li>Hot baths</li>\n \t<li>Tight or heavy clothing</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment</h3>\n \n\nMaking minor changes to your bedroom can help make night sweats less intense and help you feel comfortable faster, <a href=\"http://www.nia.nih.gov/health/hot-flashes-what-can-i-do\">according to</a> the National Institutes of Health.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Turn down the <a href=\"/perfect-temperature-sleeping/%20\">temperature in your bedroom</a>\n</li>\n \t<li>Use a ceiling fan or portable fan in your bedroom</li>\n \t<li>Remove your blankets and sheets or use <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/s/temp-products\">temperature balancing bedding</a>\n</li>\n \t<li>Wear lightweight clothing to sleep and remove layers of clothing</li>\n \t<li>Keep ice water by your bed to sip when you wake up</li>\n \t<li>Use cooling sprays or gels</li>\n \t<li>Turn your pillow over when you wake up</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Reduce Stress Through Healthy Habits</h3>\n \n\nResearch shows <a href=\"http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32701665/\">exercise improves</a> quality of life in women experiencing hot flashes.\n\n \n\nIf stress is one of your triggers for hot flashes, using stress reduction techniques during the day may reduce the frequency of night sweats:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Deep breathing techniques like this <a href=\"https://mysleep30.com/week-4/\">4-7-8 technique</a> from the Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/simple-yoga-poses-for-sleep/\">Yoga</a></li>\n \t<li>Mindfulness meditation</li>\n \t<li>Exercise</li>\n \t<li>Self-calming exercises, such as visualization</li>\n</ul>\n \n\nIn the evening, develop a calming routine that helps you wind down before you climb between the sheets. This might include dimming the lights, avoiding screens and drinking a cup of herbal tea.\n\n \n\nOne way to bring most of these techniques together at once is trying the <a href=\"http://mysleep30.com/\">Sleep30® Challenge</a> by Sleep Number. This free 30-day online wellness plan helps you develop better sleep habits so you have more energy and feel better during the day. The challenge teaches you how to set up a sleep schedule, and learn how sleep relates to eating, exercise and managing your mental health.\n\n \n\nResults have shown that 82% of people who take it experience improved sleep quality, and 74% improve or change a poor sleep habit.\n\n \n<h3>Talk to Your Healthcare Provider</h3>\n \n\nSome people try <a href=\"http://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/natural-remedies-for-hot-flashes\">herbal remedies</a> for hot flashes and night sweats, but there is <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380606/\">little evidence</a> that these are effective. If lifestyle changes and the tips above are not enough to manage your night sweats, speak with your healthcare provider.\n\n \n<h3>How to Sleep Better — Even with Hot Flashes at Night</h3>\n \n\nCheck out these great articles with more information about sleep, temperature and the health benefits of getting quality sleep.\n<ol>\n \t<li><a href=\"/everything-you-need-to-know-about-temperature-and-sleep/\">Everything about Temperature and Sleep</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/perfect-temperature-sleeping/%20\">The Perfect Temperature for Sleeping</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/what-to-eat-for-an-energetic-day-and-restful-sleep/%20\">What to Eat for an Energetic Day and Restful Sleep</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/why-do-i-sweat-when-i-sleep/%20\">Why Do I… Sweat When I Sleep? </a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"/5-surprising-health-benefits-good-nights-sleep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Surprising Health Benefits of a Good Night's Sleep</a></li>\n</ol>\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal well-being and performance.

              "html": "<i>If you've recently been sick, or want to clean your bedroom, people have asked us how to disinfect their pillows.</i>\n\n \n\nWash your hands, wipe the doorknobs — that's common advice for keeping germs at bay when the flu virus hits, or at least helping contain a breakout. But surfaces aren't the only place flu can exist. Bed linens and infected pillows can carry the virus as well.\n\n \n\nExperts agree that disinfecting pillows can help prevent the spread of the flu. Here's how to do it right.\n\n \n<h2>Step 1: Change Pillowcases Often</h2>\n \n\n<b></b>The flu virus is believed to spread via droplets expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes. For a flu sufferer lying in bed, that means a pillowcase may catch the brunt of that hacking and a-chooing, and possibly cover the pillow too. To help contain the spread in general, Carolyn Forte, director of the Good Housekeeping Home Appliances &amp; Cleaning Products Lab, tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/6-household-tips-for-stopping-the-spread-of-cold-and-flu-germs/2018/01/18/f73469be-fbcb-11e7-8f66-2df0b94bb98a_story.html\">Washington Post</a> that if you have the flu at home, change and wash the pillowcases every few days, at least.\n\n \n<h2>Step 2: Stay at Arm's Length</h2>\n \n\nIf the flu spread hits a pillow, there's a chance (however small, but still a chance) close proximity to the pillows and bed linens could spread the disease. Make sure not to hug the laundry to you. Hold it an arm's length away from your face, and take care not to touch your face or rub your eyes after.<a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"https://contently.com/stories/245666/work#sdfootnote7sym\" name=\"sdfootnote7anc\"></a>\n\n \n<h2>Step 3: Use Bleach</h2>\n \n\nSome illnesses, like norovirus, are powerful enough to sustain multiple bleach cleanings and still survive. Fortunately, the flu virus is relatively weak, especially outside of a human host. Throwing a capful of bleach into the wash can help sanitize any fabrics, notes <a href=\"https://www.rd.com/home/cleaning-organizing/clean-laundry-bacteria/\">Readers Digest</a>. This includes color-safe bleach, like OxiClean.\n\n \n<h2>Step 4: Dry on High</h2>\n \n\nThe best disinfectant may not be the wash, but the drying process. Tumble-drying laundry, including pillows, on high heat for at least 30 minutes is sufficient for killing most influenza germs. Don't hesitate to tumble dry for longer, however. Germs thrive in wet places, so pillows should be thoroughly dry to the touch before putting them back on the bed.\n\n \n<h2>Step 5: Wash Your Machines</h2>\n \n\nWash your hands and the washer, too. Say you pick up the dirty pillowcase, open the washer door, push the buttons. You may have spread germs from the pillow to the machine, and then touched the machine. While the risk of transition is slim, you may want to wipe down the machine and wash your hands, so you don't chance spreading anything when you go to switch the laundry from the washer to the dryer. The standard advice for hand washing with the goal of removing pathogens is to wash with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds.\n\n \n\n<i>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep has a profound impact on our physical, emotional and mental well-being.</i> <em>Because no two people sleep the same, Sleep Number 360® smart beds, with SleepIQ® technology, sense your movements and automatically adjust firmness, comfort and support to keep you both sleeping comfortably and provid</em><em>es</em><em> proven quality sleep.

              "html": "\"Never go to bed mad.\"\n\n \n\nThese five words are among the most common relationship advice couples get.\n\n \n\nBut is it true?\n\n \n\nAccording to couples therapists, that answer isn't so simple.\n\n \n<h2>Yes, Peace Reigns</h2>\n \n\n“It's not good to go to bed furious at each other,\" says Sherry Amatenstein, a New York City-based couples therapist and author of The Complete Marriage Counselor: Relationship-Saving Advice from America's Top 50 Couples Therapists.\n\n \n\n\"If you're just passive-aggressively fuming at the other person and wishing they'd drop off the face of the planet, if it's going to carry over for days and days of hatred,\" she warns, the other partner may feel that strain, and wonder what they did — and grow their own anger.\n\n \n\nBoth partners angry and upset probably won't make for a good night's sleep, either.\n\n \n<h2>No, It's OK</h2>\n \n\nSometimes one person wants to process everything and will not quit until it's resolved, but the other person in the couple is a \"bleary-eyed zombie\" who just wants to go to sleep.\n\n \n\n\"But that is only one person's perspective,\" says Peter Pearson, who founded <a href=\"https://www.couplesinstitute.com/welcome/\">The Couples Institute</a> with his wife, Dr. Ellyn Bader. They co-wrote the book, Tell Me No Lies.\n\n \n\n“Whether or not you go to bed angry depends on your partner's approach to conflict – you're not a one-celled amoeba where you decide for yourself in a vacuum; that's not how it works in a partnership,\" he notes.\n\n \n\n“Sometimes, in a fight, someone will say something so deep, you're not going to resolve it before you go to sleep.\"\n\n \n\nThere are some benefits to going to bed upset.\n\n \n\n“If you go to bed angry, you can regain your balance again if you sleep on it. It gives you a chance to not flare back when your outrage meter is spinning,\" Pearson says. \"When you wake up in the morning, your brain has a way of processing it so that it's not as intense, and if you talk about it you can come at it in a way that's a little more reasoned.\"\n\n \n<h2>Meet Halfway</h2>\n \n\nThere's one way to make sure you're not going to bed too mad, even without making up, Amatenstein advises. You can say: “Look, I'm angry about this thing and I don't want to talk to you right now, but we'll sort it out later.\"\n\n \n\nBasically, if you can separate the thing you're angry about from the person you're with, you will be OK.\n\n \n\n“You're going to disagree,\" she notes. “You just don't want it to be a constant.<b>\"</b>\n\n \n\nDo you resolve fights before bedtime? Or do you sleep on them instead?\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal health and performance. </em><em>Because everyone's sleep needs are different, Sleep Number 360® smart beds, with SleepIQ® technology inside, sense your movements and automatically adjust firmness, comfort and support to keep you both sleeping comfortably.

Tips on what to eat for more energy and more restful sleep.</i>\n\n \n\nYou know that <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleep-science/importance-of-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sleep is important</a> — but did you know that the foods you eat throughout the day can have a big impact on how you're feeling, and how well you sleep at night?\n\n \n\nThink about the way you want to feel and choose foods that support your goals of having an energetic day and a restful sleep.\n\n \n\nRead on to learn how food can help you have a restful night of sleep.\n\n \n<h3>Breakfast</h3>\n \n\nFirst thing in the morning, you need a breakfast that <a href=\"/forget-caffeine-natural-foods-that-give-you-more-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gives you energy</a> to start the day. It should sustain you through your morning — whether you're helping your kids start their day, getting in a workout, or leading an 8 a.m. meeting.\n\n \n\n<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/4-ways-to-boost-your-energy-naturally-with-breakfast\">According to the Harvard Medical School</a>, the best breakfasts are filled with protein and whole grains. Oatmeal can be the base for the perfect breakfast to start your day. If you want a savory breakfast, try oatmeal with an egg and some chives. If you want a sweeter meal, enjoy your oatmeal with berries and walnuts. The best part? Oatmeal can be prepared the night before for a quick breakfast. Just because it's a busy morning doesn't mean you have to <a href=\"/3-easy-make-ahead-breakfasts-for-your-busiest-mornings/\">skip breakfast</a>.\n\n \n\nIf you prefer a colder breakfast, whole grain cereals with fruit and almond milk can also boost your morning energy without relying on sugary coffee drinks.\n\n \n\nBreakfast ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Oatmeal — savory or sweet</li>\n \t<li>Whole grain cereals with fruit and almond milk</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Mid-morning Snack</h3>\n \n\nWhen you have a 10 a.m. meeting, lunch can seem very far away. Keep snacks nearby that are portable, tasty and that will help you manage your growing hunger.\n\n \n\nChoose for snacks filled with protein: Nuts like <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/269468\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">almonds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/walnuts-health-benefits#1\">walnuts</a> are filling even in small amounts, and have health benefits beyond keeping you full until lunch. To keep your snacks cost-effective and Earth-friendly, buy a bulk bag of your nuts of choice, and then portion it into reusable containers to keep near you while you work.\n\n \n\nIf nuts don't work for you, string cheese and yogurt can both give you plenty of protein to help you stay satiated until lunchtime.\n\n \n\nMid-morning snack ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Nuts</li>\n \t<li>String cheese</li>\n \t<li>Yogurt</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Lunch</h3>\nYour midday meal break should fill you up and help you stay energetic throughout the rest of the day. Foods like brown rice, sweet potatoes, lentils and quinoa all have a low glycemic index. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/energy-boosting-foods#section17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">These foods will be digested slowly</a> and keep your energy from spiking and crashing.\n\n \n\nPair those foods with lean proteins like chicken, and fruits like strawberries, avocados or bananas to fill you up with good sources of fiber.\n\n \n\nLunch ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Brown rice, sweet potatoes, lentils, quinoa</li>\n \t<li>Lean proteins</li>\n \t<li>Fruit</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Afternoon Snack</h3>\n \n\nBefore you decide on an afternoon snack, take a look at your schedule. Are you taking a yoga class after work? Consider a banana or a fruit smoothie with strawberries, oranges and spinach to make sure you have enough energy to <a href=\"/forget-caffeine-natural-foods-that-give-you-more-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">power you through your workout</a>. If your snack is there to tide you over until dinner, try a cup of air-popped popcorn to fill you up.\n\n \n\nAfternoon snack ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Banana</li>\n \t<li>Fruit <a href=\"/three-smoothies-to-power-your-new-year/\">smoothies</a> with spinach</li>\n \t<li>Air-popped popcorn</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Dinner</h3>\n \n\nWhen you're looking to wind down your day and getting ready to sleep, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-sleep-foods\">tryptophan is the amino acid</a> you want in your dinner. Tryptophan's presence in turkey is something experienced <a href=\"/avoid-the-thanksgiving-food-coma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">every Thanksgiving</a>, but you don't have to wait until November to enjoy turkey. Ground turkey can make tasty tacos or burgers.\n\n \n\nDairy is also a source of tryptophan, so foods with cheese, yogurt and milk can help you sleep better. Omega-3 fatty acids <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201810/7-ways-eating-fish-can-help-you-sleep-better\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">promote a restful night's sleep as well</a> and can be found in high doses in fish like salmon and tuna.\n\n \n\nBesides looking for soothing foods that will help you sleep, also keep in mind that caffeine sometimes lurks in unexpected places and <a href=\"/5-foods-avoid-before-sleeping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it could work against you</a>. Chocolate contains caffeine, with the darker varieties containing the most caffeine. Coffee is often used in baking chocolate goods like brownies and cake, so be sure not to overindulge on these items. Swap your after-dinner black tea with an herbal variety or leave it out completely.\n\n \n\nFor the most restful sleep, it's best to avoid caffeine after noon. Why? Six hours after you ingest caffeine, half of it is still in your system, which can interrupt your sleep causing you to feel groggy in the morning. Get smarter about <a href=\"https://mysleep30.com/caffeine-how-to/\">caffeine by reading this</a> from the sleep experts at Sleep Number®.\n\n \n\nDinner ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Meals with turkey, salmon or tuna</li>\n \t<li>Dairy (cheese, yogurt, milk)</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h3>Late-night Snack</h3>\n \n\nEven if you've done everything right, there are some nights when sleep won't come along as quickly as you would like. Sometimes, a feeling of hunger may keep you awake.\n\n \n\nOn those evenings, consider drinking some chamomile tea or milk, <a href=\"/foods-and-drinks-that-get-in-the-way-of-a-good-nights-sleep/\">avoiding alcohol</a>, and eating a banana to get another dose of tryptophan before heading back to bed. Pineapple also has a high amount of tryptophan, so consider keeping some sliced in your refrigerator or freezer for nights when you need a little help getting to sleep.\n\n \n\nLate-night snack ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Chamomile tea or milk</li>\n \t<li>Fruit, like banana or pineapple</li>\n</ul>\n \n\nLooking for more tips to improve your sleep quality?

              "html": "Ever heard the saying, “Sleep is the best medicine?\" A similar worded proverb exists in almost every culture — and for good reason.\n\n \n\nSleep is an important pillar of a strong immune system. It's nature's way of helping your body fend off attackers — something we all need right now during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n \n\nQuality sleep helps protect you from illness, keeps your immune system healthy and helps you recover faster if you do become ill. Quality sleep is also a natural immune booster, increasing your focus, mood and ability to manage stress.\n\n \n\nSo, the focus should be on getting the best QUALITY sleep you possibly can. Even if you aren't getting the number of hours your body needs per night, make sure the hours you get are the best possible quality they can be. You don't want junk sleep!\n\n \n\nHow? Keep reading ...\n\n \n<h3>Are You Getting Quality Sleep During the Pandemic?</h3>\n \n\nWith anxiety over the economy, worry about work and family and the stress and continued isolation of the global pandemic (stock market fluctuations, furloughs and childcare or school worries), is it any wonder we are not sleeping well?\n\n \n\n“My sleep was so interrupted that my husband wanted me to see a sleep therapist,\" says Shannon Huffman Polson, founder of The Grit Institute, a training resource for whole-leader development, a speaker and author of \"The Grit Factor.\"\n\n \n\nNot only is sleep essential for healthy cognitive functions, it also assists in maintaining a balance of the hormones for both physical health and emotional well-being. For decades, a solid body of research has shown that a healthy lifestyle depends on getting quality sleep. Research shows that good sleep can be a natural immunity booster, and that adequate amounts of sleep are needed for optimal resistance to infectious diseases, particularly when coupled with diet and exercise.\n\n \n\nAccording to Health Affairs, up to 70% of our health is related to behavior, environment and physical influences. Quality sleep is critical to our well-being and fundamental to our health. It is the most basic of human needs, and yet most people are just beginning to understand its value. Lack of sleep has also been linked to several diseases and conditions prevalent today, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression. Not getting enough quality sleep can also lead to injuries and disabilities caused by accidents on the road and at work. Numerous studies have found that insufficient sleep can impact everything from weight gain to mood regulation to general brain health. Moreover, lack of adequate sleep over time has been associated with a shortened lifespan.\n\n \n\nBut while logging the needed 7-9 hours nightly is noteworthy, getting the best <b>quality</b> sleep possible is crucial to keeping your immune system in fighting form. Good news is Sleep Number research shows that Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> bed owners get almost an hour's more sleep per night than the average sleeper.*\n\n \n\nWe have compiled some ways to improve the quality of your shut-eye as we continue to adapt to the COVID-19 fallout:\n\n \n<h3>Block the Blue Light</h3>\n \n\nOne of the best ways to prepare your body for a great night's sleep is to turn off devices one hour before bedtime.\n\n \n\n“You've heard that it's best to avoid screen use near bedtime (and when you can't sleep), but it's fine to use an e-reader <i>if</i> you have blocked the blue light on this device and if you read your e-book using the \"night setting\" (white letters on a black background),\" says<b> </b>Lynelle Schneeberg, PsyD, fellow, American Academy of Sleep Medicine and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Behavioral Sleep Program at Connecticut Children's Medical Center.\n\n \n\nThis will avoid exposure to the blue light that can make you feel too wakeful at night, Schneeberg adds.\n\n \n<h3>Take a Short Nap If Needed</h3>\n \n\n<b></b>You might be avoiding a daytime nap after a bout of poor sleep, but Schneeberg says it's actually fine to take a short daytime nap for 30 minutes or less when you slept poorly the night before.\n\n \n\n“A short nap does not cause an issue for your nighttime sleep as long as it's brief and as long as you take it early in the afternoon.\"\n\n \n\nYour body releases a bit of melatonin in the afternoon as if it expects a nap. So, taking a short nap after lunch might help you sail through your afternoon and evening, won't jinx your nighttime sleep and will aid in building up immunity.\n\n \n\nFor more about naps, <a href=\"/everything-you-need-to-know-about-naps/\">read this article</a>.\n\n \n<h3>Keep Pen and Paper at Your Bedside</h3>\n \n\nIt encourages a \"mind dump\" of any residual thoughts that are getting in the way of sleep, and can be used again, if racing thoughts lead to waking up in the middle of the night, explains Michelle Pargman, Ed.S. LMHC, a Jacksonville, Florida, based therapist.\n\n \n\n“Commit to writing the thoughts down, not judge them, and address them later,\" Pargman says.\n\n \n\nHere's a great article that digs into why <a href=\"/why-writing-a-to-do-list-can-improve-your-sleep/\">writing a to do list before bed can help you sleep better</a>.\n\n \n<h2>Evaluate Your Mattress</h2>\n \n\nHow old is your mattress? Do you wake up sore? Do you and your partner agree on mattress firmness or are you both tossing and turning? Do you sleep hot or cold? Does one of you snore? The right mattress, like <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com/\">Sleep Number 360® smart beds</a>, is not only shown to give you up to one hour more of sleep each night*, it can prove it through the bed's SleepIQ® technology. Your health &amp; wellness are worth investing in to help you take care of yourself so you'll be your best to help take care of others.\n\n \n<h3>Surrender Without Judgment</h3>\n \n\n<b></b>The more anxious you make yourself about not sleeping, the more sleep may elude you. So drop the internal dialogue about what a horrible day you'll have tomorrow if you don't get to sleep immediately.\n\n \n\n“The key to sound sleep lies in surrendering, not in trying harder,\" says Nancy Gerstein, a yoga teacher, author and speaker.\n\n \n\nOnce in bed, focus on your breath with deep exhales. If you have a mantra, let your mind rest in it. Try repeating “deep sleep,\" “good night,\" or “relax.\"\n\n \n<h3>Start with Small Changes</h3>\n \n\nMaking small adjustments to your sleep routine can help you get the quality sleep you need and keep your immune system in top shape.\n\n \n\n“I attributed my poor sleep to stress and possibly middle age,\" Polson says. But with the changes she's made, she's now able to go to sleep and stay asleep most nights for the first time since she had children.\n\n \n\nIf you're looking for other ways to help you have more energy during the day and boost your immunity, try the free <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a> to improve your bedtime habits.

              "html": "Every day as the sun goes down, nearly 44 million caregivers across the country are facing another night of restless sleep. These are unpaid individual (for example, a spouse, partner, family member, friend, or neighbor) involved in assisting others with activities of daily living and/or medical tasks. While science points to healthy rest as the best way to prevent caregiver burnout, it takes intentional micro and macro steps to get there.\n\n \n<h2>Around-the-Clock Care For Children or Aging Family Members</h2>\n \n\n\"If I'm not the best I can be, I can't give the best to my kids,\" says Lori Beckstrom, a teacher, mother of four, and <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number® bed</a> owner from Wichita, Kansas.\n\n \n\nBeckstrom and her husband have cared for 42 children through the foster care system over the years. Their young son has special needs and requires a higher level of hands-on care throughout the day — and night.\n\n \n\nDr. Wendy Troxel, Clinical Psychologist and Behavioral Sleep Medicine Specialist, acknowledges just how hard it is for caregivers to think of their own needs — particularly, a good night's sleep.\n\n \n\n\"There's this belief, unfortunately, that if we prioritize our sleep, that we're somehow not fulfilling our caregiving responsibilities,\" says Dr. Troxel. \"But it's quite the contrary. The caregivers absolutely need their sleep in order to fulfill that very challenging role.\"\n\n \n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF0105la0Hs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n \n\nIn addition to caring for kids, people caring for grandparents or parents with dementia know that sleep is precious. But dementia doesn't honor bedtimes.\n\n \n\nIn fact, per the Mayo Clinic, 25% of people with dementia experience disrupted sleep-wake cycles, struggle with extreme anxiety and agitation during the transition from dusk to dark (aka sundowning syndrome)— or have their mornings and evenings mixed up.\n\n \n<h2>5 Ways To Get Better Rest As A Caregiver</h2>\n \n\n<i>Here's how to fuel quality care through proven quality sleep.</i>\n\n \n<h3>1. Make Quality Sleep A Priority</h3>\n \n\nCaring for another person means you're always thinking of someone else, to the point where it feels selfish to think of your own needs. Perhaps you're just overwhelmed by all there is to do and you don't feel like you have time to rest. But you are human too, and one of the best ways you can care for yourself is through sleep. Think of how much better you feel—and how much more attentive you can be to your loved one's needs—after a regular good night's rest. Research shows that <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number<sup>®</sup> bed</a> owners get almost an hour's more sleep per night than the average sleeper.* Make sure the sleep you're getting is the best quality it can be by investing in a quality mattress proven to help.\n\n \n\nMom of four, and Sleep Number® bed owner Suzy Kessler adds, \"I want to be the best mother and support for my family. I put those needs before my own. I know that before too long they will be grown and out on their own. I now make getting quality sleep a priority.\"\n\n \n<h3>2. Choose Restful Forms Of Self-Care At Night</h3>\n \n\nAs evening approaches, do things that will help you wind down. Turn off the news and read a book of poems, or listen to peaceful music. Make a pot of decaf tea or coffee and sip slowly. Journal some thoughts from the day, and write down your to do list, or meditate for a short time. Take a warm (not hot) shower. The reason to avoid a hot shower is that your body dumps heat as it prepares for sleep; so if you're raising your body's temp it's going to take your body longer to get into sleep mode (aka fall asleep). Sit on your deck or porch and watch the sunset. Pet your cat or dog and do some gentle stretches or <a href=\"/nighttime-yoga-poses-to-do-in-bed-for-better-sleep/\">yoga poses</a>.\n\n \n\nPower down your brain and your body will follow. For more tips to create a bedtime routine that improves has 82% of participants improving their sleep quality and 74% changing a poor sleep habit, try the free <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30 Challenge by Sleep Number</a>.\n\n \n<h3>3. Do Something That Helps Both Of You To Sleep Better</h3>\n \n\nIf your young child or grandchild enjoys a bath at nighttime, make it a peaceful part of your routine too. Dim the lights in the bathroom. Use Epsom salts for soaking and essential oils to soothe the senses. Play calming music. Soak your feet while you oversee your child's time in the tub. Caring for a parent or older loved one who loves music? Relax together with a favorite evening playlist. Put comfy slippers on and get a cozy blanket or heated neck wrap while you listen.\n\n \n<h3>4. Keep The Bedroom A Sacred Space For Sleep</h3>\n \n\nDon't let worries about work or anxieties about appointments follow you to the bedroom. Leave your laptop in your home office or another devoted work space in the house.\n\n \n\nTurn your bedroom into a calming and comfortable space with blackout curtains, turning the <a href=\"/everything-you-need-to-know-about-temperature-and-sleep/\">temperature</a> down to 65-67 degrees and a <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number® smart bed</a> that's there for you at the end of a long day.\n\n \n\n\"I made a small pact with myself to start trying to do things for me that make me happy. Such as find time for massages and other relaxation,\" said special education teacher and Sleep Number® bed owner Jenny Ingram.\n\n \n<h3>5. Focus On Rest, Not Sleep</h3>\n \n\nThere's no guarantee you'll get a full 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep as a caregiver, so let go of the idea that you have to. Think about quality: not so much the when, but the how and where. Read more about how sleep affects us and what Sleep Number is doing to lead sleep science research and product development on Sleep Number's <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sleep-science\">sleep science hub</a>.\n\n \n\n\"We bought our first Sleep Number bed in December 2011 and the most recent additional one in December 2019,\" said licensed clinical social worker and Sleep Number® bed owner Anthony Weiss. \"We love that the bed adjusts to our needs throughout the night to ensure the most comfort and quality sleep. Likewise, we like that it can be controlled by our phones now... gotta admit that's pretty fun!\"\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal well-being and performance.

Going to bed knowing your breakfast is already made also sets you up for a <a href=\"/6-self-care-methods-to-boost-mental-and-physical-health/\">good night's sleep</a>.\n\n \n\nBut in the interest of eating healthy and saving time, we sometimes get stuck in a breakfast rut.\n\n \n\nIf you're looking to mix up your morning meal, chia seed pudding is a healthy and adaptable option. Whole chia seeds soaked in milk expand as they take on liquid, forming a tapioca-like texture that results in a pudding less thick than most yogurts. Mix-ins, like fruits and nuts, as well as sweeteners, let you customize the pudding to your taste.\n\n \n\nThe dish can be made in the evening and put it in the refrigerator to form overnight. Chia pudding lasts about five days in the refrigerator, so check making breakfast off your daily to-do list.\n\n \n<h1>Healthy Components</h1>\n \n\nThe most basic chia pudding recipes can be made vegan and low-carb, depending on the milk and sweetener, and only involve a few components:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A scoop of chia seeds, which <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds\">Healthline</a> notes have antioxidants as well as high amounts of fiber and protein. You'll find the seeds in most grocery and health food stores. Buy whole seeds to make a pudding with tapioca-like texture — using ground seeds will result in a smoother texture.</li>\n \t<li>Add your preferred milk, which could be cow's milk, or a nut or soy milk. Almond milk is one good low-carb option with other great benefits, according to <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/almond-milk-health-benefits#section7\">Healthline</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Mix in a sweetener, like honey or maple syrup, or leave this out for a low-sugar option.</li>\n</ul>\n \n<h1>Shake It Up</h1>\n \n\nTo make the pudding, combine one cup of milk, 2 to 4 tablespoons of seeds, and a tablespoon of sweetener in a jar or other lidded container — increase the proportions to make a bigger batch . Mix the contents with a spoon, or close the lid and shake. Place the mixture in the refrigerator to set up overnight. You may want to give the mixture one final stir or shake before bed to ensure the seeds get evenly dispersed.\n\n \n\nAfter making your first batch, you can adjust the amount of seeds and sweetener that you prefer. You can also play around with different puddings by adding cacao powder for chocolate pudding, or vanilla, cinnamon, or nut butter for other flavors. In the morning, try topping it off with fresh or dried fruit, almonds, granola or coconut flakes.\n\n \n\nThis make-ahead pudding may reduce some of the morning scramble, and become a healthy part of your <a href=\"/10-tweaks-morning-routine-will-transform-entire-day/\">morning routine</a>.\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal well-being and performance.

              "html": "Some people make and revise endless to-do lists. Others find themselves going down the rabbit hole of \"what-ifs,\" or they can't help thinking of things they haven't dealt with yet.\n\n \n\nA study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates 30% of American adults fail to get enough sleep each night and that the problem is so widespread it has become \"<a href=\"http://sleepeducation.org/news/2013/11/14/promoting-healthy-sleep-with-the-cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a public health epidemic</a>.\"\n\n \n\nWe know we need quality sleep to feel refreshed, boost our immune systems, promote good mental health, be productive and feel energized. It's also one of the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best tools</a> we have to cope with stress, especially during tumultuous times.\n\n \n\nBut what if your mind refuses to wind down at night? Sound like you?\n\n \n<h2>What You Can Do to Improve Your Sleep Quality</h2>\n \n\nSome experts call it mental or \"<a href=\"http://sleepeducation.org/essentials-in-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cognitive hygiene</a>\" — that is, dealing with invasive and even negative thoughts before you try to get some precious sleep. After all, there are some things we can control, and others we can't. Try these ideas to build mental resilience during waking hours and just before drifting off to help get a better night's sleep.\n\n \n<h3>Talk About It</h3>\n \n\nUnload what's bothering you before going to bed — it helps promote better sleep and clear the mental cobwebs. Whether you're at home with your partner, or on the phone, ask someone to hear you out.\n\n \n\nNeed to rant? Go ahead, but remember being kind to both yourself and the listener. Lashing out will only make you both feel worse.\n\n \n\nIf you need more support, there are <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/immediate-help\">numerous online resources</a> to help you face your particular challenge.\n\n \n<h3>Settle Into a Sleep Routine and Good Habits</h3>\n \n\nA calming bedtime routine can help you boost your mental state so you have an easier time falling and staying asleep. The <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a> is a free 30-day sleep wellness program, and 82% of participants improve their sleep quality and 74% improve or change bad sleep habits. Participants credit a better bedtime routine learned from the program as a huge reason for helping them sleep better. A bedtime routine isn't just for little kids. Adults and kids both benefit from helping their bodies unwind before bedtime.\n\n \n<h4>Did You Know These Bedtime-Related Facts &amp; Tips?</h4>\n \n<ol>\n \t<li>Keep your bedroom cooler to help your body dump heat and sleep better. The ideal sleep temperature is between 65-67 degrees. <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number</a> research shows 80% of couples sleep too hot or too cold.*</li>\n \t<li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time (even on weekends).</li>\n \t<li>Exercise during the day for energy and better sleep at night. Sleep Number SleepIQ® sleepers who say they exercise regularly are the most restful overall, have the highest SleepIQ® score (the higher the score the better your sleep; 100 is a perfect sleep score), and the lowest average heart rate and breath rate compared to those who exercise occasionally or rarely.</li>\n \t<li>Avoid caffeine after noon (read more about this <a href=\"https://mysleep30.com/caffeine-how-to/\">here</a>).</li>\n \t<li>SleepIQ® sleepers who sleep in a pitch-black bedroom are more restful overall and achieve higher SleepIQ® scores than those who sleep with light in their bedroom.</li>\n \t<li>Have a comfortable mattress that can adjust to you. Science shows us that loss of sleep or poor sleep could adversely affect your immune system, leaving you susceptible to colds and other illnesses. Quality sleep is a natural immune booster, helping our focus, mood and ability to manage stress. Compared to average sleepers, <a href=\"http://www.sleepnumber.com\">Sleep Number® bed</a> owners enjoy almost an hour's more sleep per night.**</li>\n</ol>\n \n\nNot enough? Let's add some mind-calming boosts to the mix.\n\n \n<h3>Quiet the Mind &amp; Breathe</h3>\n \n\nOne of the best ways to quiet the endless thoughts is to <a href=\"/how-to-meditate-before-bed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meditate</a>. A recent <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475686/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> shows that meditation in the U.S. population indicates an effective method of \"reducing physical, mental and emotional disturbances,\" in both children and adults (Black, Barnes, Clarke, and Stussman, Nahin, 2018).\n\n \n\nDownload your favorite app, join an online group, or watch digital tutorials during the day to implement a meditation practice that helps you stay calm and focused on happier thoughts.\n\n \n\nSome people like to start with breathing exercises, which are easy to do and have huge benefits — it's the <a href=\"/conquer-stress-with-these-5-nightly-yoga-poses/\">key to yoga</a>, another excellent way to calm the mind and body before bedtime:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Lie down in your comfy bed, and put your right hand over your heart and your left on your abdomen.</li>\n \t<li>Now breathe in deeply through your nose to the count of four or five.</li>\n \t<li>Hold your breath for four seconds, and exhale through your mouth for five, six or seven seconds.</li>\n \t<li>Picture a huge straw going from your nose into your belly, filling it up and expanding your ribs.</li>\n \t<li>When you exhale, imagine all of your negative thoughts being washed away with your breath.</li>\n</ol>\n \n\n<b></b>When you're stressed, your breathing gets faster and shorter, telling your brain to go into panic mode. This slow, intentional breathing has the exact opposite effect.\n\n \n<h3>Focus (on the good stuff)</h3>\n \n\nPerception is everything: What we choose to see and do becomes our everyday reality.\n\n \n\nTalk kindly to yourself and fixate on the good things in your life when you're feeling stressed out.\n\n \n\nSome of those pluses might include a safe place to shelter, your health, family you love, friends you can count on, the nature surrounding you, your pet's cuddles or a really good joke. Listen to music that puts a smile on your face.\n\n \n\nLet those joy-inducing things be your daily guide to a better state of mind and better quality sleep.\n\n \n\nAlso, pay it forward and try doing something good for someone in need; a neighbor, a parent, a colleague, a teacher, or a total stranger.\n\n \n\nRandom acts of kindness — like buying a coffee or picking up the bill in a grocery store for someone in need — have a way of uplifting your own emotions. Thanks to the feel-good hormone oxytocin, which is part of a whole <a href=\"https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/the-science-of-kindness#:~:text=Hamilton%2C%20acts%20of%20kindness%20create,as%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccardioprotective%E2%80%9D%20hormone.\">chemical chain reaction</a> that happens when you do something good for someone, your whole outlook can change for the better.\n\n \n\nEvery positive step counts — how we think, respond and react to any given situation — and your built-up mental resilience can help improve your sleep quality. Soon enough, it's a new daily routine, like brushing your teeth.\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal well-being and performance.

              "html": "Self care can be serious business. Finding supportive practitioners, eating well, exercising, and getting quality sleep yield fabulous results, but these practices can also feel heavy when you're working too hard to do them right.\n\n \n\nBut as multiple memes and Twitter threads attest, <em>laughing </em>at the sometimes silly lengths we go to in the pursuit of wellness is, in itself, a form of self care. Take yourself too seriously, Steven M. Sultanoff, professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, says in an interview, and \"you are not using self care about your self care.\"\n\n \n<h2>With Self Care, Ask, Don't Tell</h2>\n \n\nSelf care can feel lighter when we ask for healthful changes rather than demanding them of ourselves.\n\n \n\n\"People who think in language that is requesting — I want, I wish, I would like, I hope —have less emotional distress,\" says Sultanoff, who specializes in the psychological impact of humor.\n\n \n\nBy contrast, demanding self care through \"I should\" statements like, \"I should take a hot bath,\" or \"I should exercise more,\" is neither nurturing nor sustainable. Stuck in this kind of demanding thought pattern, says Sultanoff, \"people are doing self care behaviors, but cognitively they are counteracting their self care with negative thinking.\"\n\n \n<h2>Smile Yourself to Sleep</h2>\n \n\nLaughing out loud has physical benefits, including a release of muscle tension, because it involves taking deep breaths while expanding and contracting our muscles.\n\n \n\nBut laughter is an energizing stimulus, Sultanoff says, which means LOLing isn't a great way to prepare to fall asleep.\n\n \n\nInstead, he recommends a \"humor visualization,\" where you visualize a past event, from that day or long ago, that makes you smile.\n\n \n\n\"As I get in bed and am going to sleep, I think about a moment that was really delightful,\" says Sultanoff. \"The humorous visualization, just like any visualization, will slow down the thought process, may be enough to cause me to fall asleep.\"\n\n \n<h2>Tease Yourself — Gently</h2>\n \n\nIf you skipped your workout because you were too busy Googling kale smoothie recipes, it might be time to gently laugh at yourself.\n\n \n\n\"People are able to gain perspective and see that the situation they put themselves in may be excessive or absurd,\" says Sultanoff. Cultivating this skill is productive because it releases the pressure of being perfectly self-cared-for at all times. This can go too far if you slip from light self-deprecation to a heavier feeling, like self-loathing.\n\n \n\n\"You can be playful with yourself, make fun of yourself, but not in a way that is putting yourself down,\" Sultanoff saiys. \"It's productive when you're laughing at the situation you're in and saying, look how silly or ridiculous this is.\"\n\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal health and performance. </em><em>Because everyone's sleep needs are different, Sleep Number 360® smart beds, with SleepIQ® technology inside, sense your movements and automatically adjust firmness, comfort and support to keep you both sleeping comfortably.

              "html": "Embarrassing, maybe, but drooling while you're sleeping is generally no cause for alarm. If you don't like the sensation of waking up to a damp pillow, the sleep experts at Sleep Number explain why people drool, and how to reduce its occurrence.\n\n \n<h2>Reasons for Hypersalivating</h2>\n \n\nDrooling, or hypersalivating, is a result of having too much saliva in your mouth or having difficulties swallowing the saliva you do produce. One of the most common causes of drooling is sleeping position. Side and stomach sleepers may drool more often because the accumulated saliva gathers at the sides of the mouth and leaks out.\n\n \n\nHypersalivating is also common during seasonal allergy or cold and flu season, as the body produces more saliva to fight the foreign organisms that are responsible for symptoms such as a runny nose or watery eyes.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, gastrointestinal reflux disorder (GERD), which can cause heartburn, can also increase production of saliva as the body works to soothe the irritation caused by the backup of stomach acid in the esophagus.\n\n \n\nThose who snore and sleep with their mouth open don't swallow as much during the night, which also triggers drooling as the saliva accumulates in the mouth.\n\n \n\nLess swallowing means more saliva which means more drooling, according to Sleep Number experts.\n\n \n\nCertain medications, such as antidepressants, can also cause dry mouth or excess saliva, which can also result in drooling while sleeping.\n\n \n<h2>Tips to Stop Drooling</h2>\n \n\nOccasional drooling is a symptom of something else, rather than a problem in and of itself. Here's some tips to reduce drooling:\n\n \n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<b>Treat the underlying condition.</b> Consult your healthcare provider to see if you need medication for allergies or a sinus infection. If drooling is a chronic problem, let your practitioner know in order to rule out anything serious.</li>\n \t<li>\n<b>Change your sleeping position. </b>Sleeping on your back or raising your head with a wedge pillow or adjustable bed will help gravity prevent saliva from coming out of your mouth.</li>\n \t<li>\n<b>Maintain a healthy balance of saliva in your mouth.</b> According to a study reported in the <a href=\"http://www.bjmp.org/content/management-drooling-saliva?_ga=2.268815479.72440379.1507584170-197297807.1507584170\">British Journal of Medical Practitioners</a>, some home remedies include biting on a lemon wedge and drinking plenty of water, both of which are thought to thin out the saliva, making it less likely to pool in your mouth.</li>\n \t<li>\n<b>Use an oral appliance. </b>Also called a mandibular device, these appliances look like a mouth guard and aid in swallowing while also keeping the jaw aligned and the mouth closed.</li>\n</ol>\n \n\n<em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep is essential for optimal health and performance. </em><em>Because everyone's sleep needs are different, Sleep Number 360® smart beds, with SleepIQ® technology inside, sense your movements and automatically adjust firmness, comfort and support to keep you both sleeping comfortably.

You might not be able to get the number of hours of sleep you need — life happens — so focus on making sure the sleep you do get is the best <u>QUALITY</u> it can be. People who routinely use the Sleep Number 360® smart bed features and SleepIQ® technology can improve their quality sleep by more than 15 minutes a night — nearly 100 (yes 100) more hours each year — by delivering personal insights into heart rate, breathing and movement, as well as natural sleep and wake cycles.* Studies show that even 15 more minutes of quality sleep per night increases a body's ability to stave off a cold or weight gain and can increase productivity.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Develop a bedtime routine.</strong> Two weeks before DST, start sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time if you don't already. One week before DST, gradually start shifting both your bedtime and wake time in 15-minute to 30-minute increments, to make up the deficit of losing that hour. And, don't stress if you're reading this and Daylight Saving is only a couple days away. Start tonight. Sleep Number SleepIQ® sleepers planned ahead and went to bed<br>earlier the night Daylight Saving Time began, and woke up later.***** As a result, they only lost 15 minutes of snooze time<br>instead of an hour. Bet that felt good!</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":10485} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Additional Tips for Good Sleep</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":10485} /-->\n\n\n<p>Resetting your internal sleep rhythms is the trickier part. Here are a few more tips to help reset your sleep system and develop good sleep habits — for DST, and also year-round. If you're looking to hack your sleep and get step-by-step advice, take the free <a href=\"http://www.mysleep30.com/challenge\">Sleep30® Challenge by Sleep Number</a> that's helped 82% of participants improve their sleep quality, and 74% improve or change a bad sleep habit.****</p>\n\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":10485} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":11352,\"width\":400,\"height\":300,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-11352\" src=\"/media/W1siZiIsIndvcmthcmVhL2NvbnRlbnQvYXNzZXRzL3BsYWNlaG9sZGVyIl1d/placeholder.png?sha=66bab4576cc0c6c1\" alt=\"Person holding cup of coffee being brewed.\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"></figure>\n</div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Avoid stimulants, like caffeine, in the late afternoon and evening.</strong> SleepIQ® data confirms sleepers who regularly drink caffeine after noon are less restful and sleep far less than those who never do. Those who regularly drink caffeine in the evening have 19 fewer minutes of restful sleep each night than those who never do.** Do this every day and those 19 minutes of poor sleep per night could add up to almost 115 hours of junk sleep per year!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dim the lights an hour before bed. </strong> Install dimmers on bedroom lights. Replace blue-tone light bulbs with warm, reddish/orange hue light bulbs. Blackout curtains are great or try an inexpensive sleep mask.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prepare for the next day. </strong> Pick your outfit for the next day and lay it out the night before. Make lunches ahead of time. Write your to-do list. Pack bags by the door. Set your wake-up alarm. Generally, the more organized you are at night and prepare for the next day, the calmer, more relaxed you are and the better you'll sleep.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Adjust your bed for maximum comfort.</strong> Have a comfortable mattress and pillow. Your mattress accounts for 75% of your comfort while you sleep. Since you spend 1/3 of your life in bed, you need it to be comfortable to help you tackle whatever it is that gets you up in the morning. If you're interested in seeing where your body's pressure points are and how to reduce them for better sleep, visit a <a href=\"https://www.sleepnumber.com/sn/en/find-mattress-stores\">Sleep Number® store</a> and ask them to help you find your Sleep Number® setting. More than one-third of SleepIQ® sleepers have a Sleep Number® setting of 35, 40 or 45***. Sleep Professionals will show you a 3D map of your body lying on the bed and show how a smart bed can automatically adjust to you as you sleep for the ultimate in comfort on each side of the bed.
